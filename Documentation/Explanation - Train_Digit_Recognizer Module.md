# Handwritten-Multiple-Digits-Recognizer

# Complete Code Explanation For The Train_Digit_Recognizer Module Of The Project

### 1. First the relevant libraries have been imported for our backend code:



### 2. The data is being loaded and segregated into testing data and training data, the access for this will be under the hands of the admin of the datastore.



### 3. Here the algorithm for our Digit recognition is being implemented whereby the dimensions of the images are being defined to maintain uniformity in the data and the same time it is being trained for the prediction of digits which the user may input.



### 4. After the implementation of the algorithm here the dataset is being resized and converted in the right format and assigned to the right parts of the datstore namely train, and test.



### 5. Finally, the model is compiled and optimized before we move on to save the model which would be used by the next module of our project code.



### 6. Finally the datastore is saved as an h5 file format which shall be called by our GUI Module of the Digit Recognition System project.
