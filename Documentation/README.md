# Handwritten-Multiple-Digits-Recognizer

## The code for our backend has been documented and explained below:

### 1. First we start with the importing of the libraries used for the creation of our GUI:



### 2. Next we use the Module 1 of our project namely the backend that we created in the previous experiment i.e Experiment 8 of Lab. The saved model is now being called in our Module 2 for the use of Recognizing the digits when the user inputs one:



### 3. We initialize the GUI by creating a window and giving the title of our Software as “Digit Recognition System”



### 4. Next, we create the Canvas or the drawing area for our Digit Recognition System. In this area, we shall be creating the drawing space for the user wherein they can draw the English numerical digits with the help of their mouse or trackpad.



### 5. Here the clear widget is defined whereby the output of the user can be cleared when the user clicks on the clear output button



### 6. The below function allows the user to draw digits with the help of the mouse or trackpad on the drawing area of the software or what we have defined as the canvas.



### 7. The below function creates the main functionality of the software that is the prediction of the digits that the user draws on the canvas



### 8. Here the additional functionality of retrieving the last recognized digit frame and saving it in the directory folder of the software system



### 9. The below function creates the Feedback button whereby the user can click and redirect to the browser window with a feedback form to fill about their experience regarding this Digit Recognition System Software.



### 10. Below lines of code depict the creation of buttons for the system where the height, width, text and alignment of the button on the software system.
